# My macOS configurations and apps

This is my collection of the configurations for the various tools I use.

# Pre-requirements

Before using these dotfiles on a new Mac I need to setup the following things:

1) Install 1Password
2) Setup ssh-keys

# Installation

Running `./install.sh` will install Homebrew and install my favorite apps including their configurations.

## Inspiration

Thanks to others who shared their dotfiles publicly on GitHub. I used examples from the following repositories:
